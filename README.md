# cherryscript
A very simple to learn programming language
### Note this is just a proof of concept.A fun hobby if you will :D
## current progress
* print - used to display text(no need for double quotes or paranthesis)
* jump - used to execute a line.
* end - used to end a .cheri file (this is required)
* loop - used to execute a line a given number of times
* add - used to add two numbers
* diff - used to subtract two numbers
* mul - used to multiply two values
* div - used to divide two numbers
* var - used to create a variable
* assign - used to assign or change a variable value
* inc - used to increment an integer variable
 ### if anyone wants to help me in the development please let me know in github issues
 ## How to use
<p>To run a .cheri file just download the interpreter i.e cherryscript.py.
<p>make a .cheri file in the same folder as the interpreter
<p>run the following command in the terminal(linux) or command prompt(windows)
<p>For windows
<p>python3.exe cherryscript.py "your program.cheri"
<p>without quotes of course</p>
<p>For linux
<p>python3 cherryscript.py "your program.cheri"
<p>without quotes of course</p>
 
 ## General instructions
<p> Variables always start with a '$'</p>
<p> Dont forget to specify int for numbers or str for words
<p> You can store the result of a math command in a variable by putting a variable's name after it
<p>loop can be used to run lines after 'end'</p>
