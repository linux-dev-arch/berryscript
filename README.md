<p>make a .ci file in the same folder as the interpreter
<p>run the following command in the terminal(linux) or command prompt(windows)
<p>For windows
<p>python3.exe cherryscript.py "your program.cheri"
<p>without quotes of course</p>
<p>For linux
<p>python3 cherryscript.py "your program.cheri"

 ## General instructions
<p> You can use '// ' for comments

<p> Dont forget to specify int for numbers or str for words
<p> You can store the result of a math command in a variable by putting a variable's name after it
